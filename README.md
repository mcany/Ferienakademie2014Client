#Neverrest Android Client

This is the Neverrest android client developed as part of the Ferienakademie 2014. Please note that it does not represent a finished product ready for production, but rather a study on how such a game could look like. For the complete concept please refer to https://github.com/Maddoc42/Ferienakademie2014Client/blob/master/nEVERrEST/docu/Concept.docx
